Bachelor's Thesis - Computer Science &amp; Engineering

## Introduction

‚úÖ In today‚Äôs world, security breaches, crime rates, and accidents are on the rise, putting the safety of individuals in jeopardy. From road accidents to alarming cases like kidnapping, human trafficking, and even eve-teasing, the lack of effective surveillance systems is a growing concern. 

‚úÖ The Online Surveillance System is an **Android-based application**. My app ensures that help is just a click away.

‚úÖ By integrating real-time surveillance with location tracking, this system aims to reduce crime, improve emergency response times, and provide an essential tool for personal safety. 

## Problem Statement üö®

The rise in criminal activities and accidents reveals significant flaws in our public security systems, including:

- Delay in providing first aid or immediate assistance to victims.
- Lack of accessible emergency alert systems for the general public.
- Slow and inaccurate crime/accident location identification.
- Inadequate tracking systems to apprehend culprits promptly.
- Limited public support during emergencies.

## Solution üí°

The Online Surveillance System app is designed to address these concerns by providing a set of powerful features:

- Panic Button: Instantly send emergency alerts to authorities with a single click.
- Live Tracking: Track your real-time location and share it with loved ones or authorities for enhanced security.
- Incognito Mode: For undercover surveillance, track discreetly without being detected.
- Safety Zones: Visualize nearby safety zones, like police stations, hospitals, and emergency centres on the map.

## Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- Emergency Alerts: Send instant distress signals to designated contacts and authorities.
- Live Location Tracking: Share your real-time location for faster emergency response.
- Safety Zone Maps: Identify safe zones in your area, including emergency services.
- Sting Operations: Record and upload videos/audio of critical situations to the server for review.
- Real-time Communication: Seamless interaction between users and authorities using live communication technologies.

## Technologies Used üîß

- **Frontend**:  
  - JavaScript  
  - HTML  
  - CSS

- **Backend**:  
  - PHP  
  - JSON  
  - AJAX

- **Live Communication**:  
  - Node.js  
  - Socket.io

- **APIs**:

  - Emergency Alert API (for efficient alert handling)

## How It Works ‚ö°

1. **Install the App**: Download and install the "Online Surveillance System" app on your Android device.
2. **Activate the Panic Button**: Press the panic button in case of an emergency to alert authorities and your contacts.
