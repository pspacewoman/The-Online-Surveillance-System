# The Online Surveillance System üö®üì±

## Introduction

In today‚Äôs world, security breaches, crime rates, and accidents are on the rise, putting the safety of individuals in jeopardy. From road accidents to alarming cases like kidnapping, human trafficking, and even eve-teasing, the lack of effective surveillance systems is a growing concern. **The Online Surveillance System** is an Android-based application designed to enhance public security through real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, and interactive safety features.

By integrating real-time surveillance with location tracking, this system aims to reduce crime, improve emergency response times, and provide an essential tool for personal safety. Whether it's a road accident, a security breach, or a distressing emergency, our app ensures that help is just a click away.

## Problem Statement üö®

The rise in criminal activities and accidents reveals significant flaws in our public security systems, including:

- Delay in providing first aid or immediate assistance to victims.
- Lack of accessible emergency alert systems for the general public.
- Slow and inaccurate crime/accident location identification.
- Inadequate tracking systems to apprehend culprits promptly.
- Insufficient evidence for investigations.
- Limited public support during emergencies.
- Inefficiencies in traditional security and surveillance systems.

## Solution üí°

The **Online Surveillance System** app is designed to address these concerns by providing a set of powerful features:

- **Panic Button**: Instantly send emergency alerts to authorities with a single click.
- **Live Tracking**: Track your real-time location and share it with loved ones or authorities for enhanced security.
- **Incognito Mode**: For undercover surveillance, track discreetly without being detected.
- **Safety Zones**: Visualize nearby safety zones such as police stations, hospitals, and emergency centers on the map.
- **Sting Operation Support**: Live stream, record, and upload audio-video content directly from the app to the system server for surveillance and monitoring.

## Key Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Emergency Alerts**: Send instant distress signals to designated contacts and authorities.
- **Live Location Tracking**: Share your real-time location for faster emergency response.
- **Safety Zone Maps**: Identify safe zones in your area, including emergency services.
- **Incognito Mode**: Keep your surveillance undetectable for covert operations.
- **Sting Operations**: Record and upload videos/audio of critical situations to the server for review.
- **Real-time Communication**: Seamless interaction between users and authorities using live communication technologies like Node.js and Socket.io.

## Technologies Used üîß

- **Frontend**:  
  - JavaScript  
  - HTML  
  - CSS

- **Backend**:  
  - PHP  
  - JSON  
  - AJAX

- **Live Communication**:  
  - Node.js  
  - Socket.io

- **APIs**:  
  - Google Maps API (for real-time geolocation and safety zone mapping)  
  - Emergency Alert API (for efficient alert handling)

## How It Works ‚ö°

1. **Install the App**: Download and install the "Online Surveillance System" app on your Android device.
2. **Activate the Panic Button**: Press the panic button in case of an emergency to alert authorities and your contacts.
3. **Track in Real-Time**: Use the live tracking feature to share your exact location with others or emergency services.
4. **Use Incognito Mode**: When required, enable the incognito mode for undetectable location tracking and surveillance.
5. **Access Safety Zones**: View nearby police stations, hospitals, and safe zones on the map.
6. **Start a Sting Operation**: Record and stream videos or audio directly from the app to the monitoring cell for further action.
